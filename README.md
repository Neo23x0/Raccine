# Raccine

A Simple Ransomware Protection 

## Why

We see ransomware delete all shadow copies using `vssadmin` pretty often. What if we could just intercept that request and kill the invoking process? Let's try to create a simple vaccine.

![Ransomware Process Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neo23x0/Raccine/main/images/screen4.png)

## How it works

We [register a debugger](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012/) for `vssadmin.exe` (and `wmic.exe`), which is our compiled `raccine.exe`. Raccine is a binary, that first collects all PIDs of the parent processes and then tries to kill all parent processes. 

Advantages:

- The method is rather generic
- We don't have to replace a system file (`vssadmin.exe` or `wmic.exe`), which could lead to integrity problems and could break our raccination on each patch day 
- Flexible YARA rule scanning of command line params for malicious activity
- The changes are easy to undo
- Runs on Windows 7 / Windows 2008 R2 or higher
- No running executable or additional service required (agent-less)

Disadvantages / Blind Spots:

- The legitimate use of `vssadmin.exe delete shadows` (or any other blacklisted combination) isn't possible anymore
- It even kills the processes that tried to invoke `vssadmin.exe delete shadows`, which could be a backup process
- This won't catch methods in which the malicious process isn't one of the processes in the tree that has invoked `vssadmin.exe` (e.g. via `schtasks`)

### The Process

1. Invocation of `vssadmin.exe` (and `wmic.exe`) gets intercepted and passed to `raccine.exe` as debugger (`vssadmin.exe delete shadows` becomes `raccine.xe vssadmin.exe delete shadows`)
2. We then process the command line arguments and look for malicious combinations using Yara rules.
3. If no malicious combination could be found, we create a new process with the original command line parameters. 
4. If a malicious combination could be found, we collect all PIDs of parent processes and the start killing them (this should be the malware processes as shown in the screenshots above). Raccine shows a command line window with the killed PIDs for 5 seconds, logs it to the Windows Eventlog and then exits itself. 

Malicious combinations:

- `delete` and `shadows` (vssadmin, diskshadow)
- `resize` and `shadowstorage` (vssadmin)
- `delete` and `shadowstorage` (vssadmin)
- `delete` and `shadowcopy` (wmic)
- `delete` and `catalog` and `-quiet` (wbadmin)
- `win32_shadowcopy` or element from a list of encoded commands (powershell)
- `recoveryenabled` (bcedit)
- `ignoreallfailures` (bcedit)

Powershell list of encoded commands: `JAB`, `SQBFAF`, `SQBuAH`, `SUVYI`, `cwBhA`, `aWV4I`, `aQBlAHgA` and many more

The infection gets nipped in the bud. 

## Warning !!!

USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

You won't be able to run commands that use the blacklisted commands on a raccinated machine anymore until your apply the uninstall patch `raccine-reg-patch-uninstall.reg`. This could break various backup solutions that run that specific command during their work. It will not only block that request but kills all processes in that tree including the backup solution and its invoking process.

If you have a solid security monitoring that logs all process executions, you could check your logs to see if `vssadmin.exe delete shadows`, `vssadmin.exe resize shadowstorage ...` or the other blocked command lines are frequently or sporadically used for legitimate purposes in which case you should refrain from using Raccine.

## Installation

### Requirements

- VC++ Runtime for YARA scanning (Installer contains the setup package from [https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe))
- .NET Framework 4.5
- Internet access for the YARA rule updates
- Windows 7 / Windows 2008 R2 or higher

Both the Visual C++ Redistributable package and the .NET Framework will be automatically installed running `install-raccine.bat`.

### Automatic Installation

1. Download `Raccine.zip` from the [Release](https://github.com/Neo23x0/Raccine/releases/) section
2. Extract it
3. Run `raccine-installer.bat` as administrator

![Windows Batch Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neo23x0/Raccine/main/images/raccine-installer.png)

The batch installer includes an "uninstall" option.

### Manual Uninstall 

As Administrator do:

1. Run `raccine-reg-patch-uninstall.reg` 
2. Remove `%ProgramFiles%\Raccine` and `%ProgramData%\Raccine folders
3. Run `reg delete HKCU\Software\Raccine /F`
4. Run `taskkill /F /IM RaccineSettings.exe` 
5. Run `reg delete "HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /V "Raccine Tray" /F`
6. Run `schtasks /DELETE /TN "Raccine Rules Updater" /F`

## Updates

### Program Upgrade

We recommend an uninstall and reinstall to upgrade. An uninstall removes all registry keys with configurations. 

### Signature Update

Raccine has an integrated signature-updater since version 1.2. This program named `RaccineRulesSync.exe` is configured to run once a day via scheduled task. You can run a signature update manually using the option in the tray icon menu. 

## YARA Matching

Since version 1.0, Raccine additionally uses YARA rules to determine if a process command line or parent process is malicious or not. Raccine uses 2 sets of rules for two different purposes. 

1. `./yara` - rules that get applied to the command line with all parameters, e.g. `WMIC.exe delete justatest`
2. `./yara/in-memory` - rules that get applied to process memory of the parent process of our intercepted process, e.g. ransomware.exe running our intercepted process vssadmin.exe  

### YARA External Variables

Since version 1.1 we pass a list of external variables into the YARA matching process to allow for much more complex and clever YARA rules that take attributes of the process and its parent into account. 


| Variable             | Description                              | Example Value                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| FromRaccine          |                                          | true                              |
| Name                 | Image file name                          | WMIC.exe                          |
| ExecutablePath       | Full path to binary                      | C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WMIC.exe |
| CommandLine          | Full command line with parameters        | WMIC.exe delete justatest         |
| Priority             | Process priority                         | 32                                |
| ParentName           | Parent image file name                   | cmd.exe                           |
| ParentExecutablePath | Full path to parent executable           | C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe       | 
| ParentCommandLine    | Full parent command line with parameters | C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe       |
| ParentPriority       | Parent process priority                  | 32                                |

The matching process looks like this on the command line:

```batch
"C:\Program Files\Raccine\yara64.exe" -d FromRaccine="true" -d Name="WMIC.exe" -d ExecutablePath="C:\Windows\System32\wbem\WMIC.exe" -d CommandLine="WMIC.exe delete justatest" -d  Priority=32 -d FromRaccine="true" -d ParentName="cmd.exe" -d ParentExecutablePath="C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" -d ParentCommandLine="'C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe' " -d ParentPriority=32 C:\ProgramData\Raccine\yarayara\mal_emotet.yar C:\ProgramData\Raccine\yara\Rac1C6A.tmp
```

The following listing shows an example YARA rule that makes use of the external variables in its coindition. 

```javascript 
rule env_vars_test {
    condition:
        Name contains "WMIC.exe"
        and CommandLine contains "delete justatest"
        and ParentPriority >= 8
        and (
            ParentCommandLine contains "cmd"
            or ParentCommandLine contains "powershell"
        )
}
```

## Deploy Configuration via GPO

The folder `GPO` includes `Raccine.ADMX` and `Raccine.ADML`. In deployment the `Raccine.ADMX` file goes in `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions`. The accompanying `Raccine.ADML` files goes in `C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US`. 

To use: Open `GPEDIT.MSC` > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Raccine

After configuring the changes, you may need to bump gpo by running `gpupdate.exe`.

## Logfile

A logfile with all interceptions and actions taken is written to `C:\ProgramData\Raccine\Raccine_log.txt` 

![Log File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neo23x0/Raccine/main/images/logfile.png)

## Windows Eventlog

An entry is generated by every blocking event in the `Application` eventlog. 

![Eventlog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Neo23x0/Raccine/main/images/eventlog2.png)

The IDs that Raccine generates

- EventId 1 - Setup activity
- EventId 2 - Malicious activity detected
- EventId 3 - Benign activity detected

## Simulation Mode

Since version 0.10.0, Raccine can be installed in "simulation mode", which activates all triggers, logs all actions but doesn't kill anything. This mode should be used in environments in which backup solutions or other legitimate software for a reasonable amount of time to check if Raccine would interfere with other software. The idea is to install Raccine in simulation mode, let it log for a week or month and then check the logs to see if it would have blocked legitimate software used in the organisation.

## Screenshot

Run `raccine.exe` and watch the parent process tree die (screenshot of v0.1)

## GUI

Available and required since version 1.

## Pivot

In case that the Ransomware that your're currently handling uses a certain process name, e.g. `taskdl.exe`, you could just change the `.reg` patch to intercept calls to that name and let Raccine kill all parent processes of the invoking process tree.

## Help Wanted

I'd like to extend Raccine but lack the C++ coding skills, especially on the Windows platform.

## Help - My System is Broken

If anything happens to your installation, e.g. sudden error messages, broken services or programs that won't start anymore, run the file `raccine-reg-patch-uninstall.reg` in the `reg-patches` sub folder. This should bring everything back to normal. 

After that you should also be able to run a full uninstallation using `install-raccine.bat`.

## Other Info

The right pronounciation is "Rax-Een".
